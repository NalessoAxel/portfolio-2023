		description:
			"A new look for the mmwba website.The old site's design was not up to date or intuitive. I focused on the UX/UI aspect by making the information more accessible with a modern touch. The old site being under WordPress, I continue to work with it so that the client is not lost and finds these landmarks, I kept this cms but I switched to headless mode, which allows me to have more flexibility for the data fetching as well as instant page loading times by pre-displaying the HTML code of the wordpress content. In technical terms, I used a React framework and Next.js. To retrieve WordPress content, I employed GraphQL. front-end is deployed on Vercel, the backend is deployed on o2switch.",
